# Newton's method - tangent method
The tangent method is designed to find the approximate zero of the function, but in this method we use, instead of dividing the interval in half, the intersection of the tangent to our function with the OX axis.   
The result is the approximate zero of the function, the value of the function at the zero (which should be close to 0 with the adopted tolerance), and the computation time.   
However, if we adopt an initial approximation that is too far from the correct zero point, then our algorithm will require a very large number of iterations to achieve the correct result, or it will not converge.
